# LLM Tool

<Intro />

## Tool details
**Tool ID:** `llm_tool`

**Tool description:** Jack of all trades tool to respond to a prompt by relying solely on LLM capabilities. YOU NEVER CALL OTHER TOOLS. You use your native capabilities as an LLM only. This includes using your general knowledge and your in-built reasoning. This tool can be used to summarize the outputs of other tools, make general language model queries or to answer questions. This should be used only as a last resort when no other tool satisfies a step in a task, however if there are no other tools that can be used to complete a step or for steps that don't require a tool call, this SHOULD be used. MAKE SURE the task_data includes ALL INPUT VARIABLES IN THE CONTEXT.
