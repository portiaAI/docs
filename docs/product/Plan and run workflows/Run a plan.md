# Run a plan
Learn how to run a plan run from an existing plan or end-to-end.
:::tip[TL;DR]
- A plan run is (uncontroversially) a unique run of a plan. It is represented by the `PlanRun` class (<a href="/SDK/portia/plan_run" target="_blank">**SDK reference ↗**</a>).
- An agent is spun up to execute every step in the plan run. The `PlanRun` object tracks the state of the plan run and is enriched at every step by the relevant agent.
- A plan run can be generated from a plan using the `run_plan` method. 
- You can also plan a query response, then create and execute a plan run in one fell swoop using the `run` method of the `Portia` instance class (<a href="/SDK/portia/portia" target="_blank">**SDK reference ↗**</a>).
:::

## Overview of plan runs in Portia
Portia captures the state of a plan run at every step in an auditable way. This includes:
- A step index tracking at which step we are in the plan run.
- The actual plan run state e.g. NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE, READY_TO_RESUME or NEED_CLARIFICATION.
- A list of step outputs that is populated throughout the plan run.

In a later section we will also see that a plan run state also tracks the list of instances where human input was solicited during plan run, known as `Clarification`.

Plan run states are captured in the `PlanRun` class (<a href="/SDK/portia/plan_run" target="_blank">**SDK reference ↗**</a>). In the previous section (<a href="/generate-plan" target="_blank">**Generate a plan ↗**</a>), we generated a plan in response to the query `Which stock price grew faster in 2024, Amazon or Google?`. Let's examine the final state once we run that plan:

Every plan run has a unique `id` and relates to a unique `plan_id`. If you were to attempt running the same plan multiple times, you would generate multiple `PlanRun` objects each with a unique `id` but all with the same `plan_id` property.

## Plan run state changes
As Portia cycles through a plan run, an execution agent is instantiated at every step and that agent will call the tool designated for that. The plan run state is enriched with step outputs at every step of the execution as well. Note that in this example the main tool used is the 'Search Tool' provided in this SDK in the `example_tool_registry`, and wraps around the Tavily API. We will discuss tools in more depth in the next section.
You should be able to inspect the state changes for the above plan run in the logs when you run the code.

## Run from a pre-expressed plan
<details>
<summary>**Tavily API key required**</summary>

We will use a simple GET endpoint from Tavily in this section. Please sign up to obtain an API key from them (<a href="https://tavily.com/" target="_blank">**↗**</a>) and set it in the environment variable `TAVILY_API_KEY`.
</details>

To get to an output that looks like the plan run example above, let's expand on the code we used to generate a plan in the previous section (<a href="/generate-plan" target="_blank">**↗**</a>) by adding code to create and execute a plan run from that plan. This approach gives you the opportunity to serve that plan to the user and get their feedback / iterate on it before running the plan run for example. Here is the code to do that:
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="sync" label="Sync" default>
```python title="main.py"
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from portia import (
    Portia,
    example_tool_registry,
)

load_dotenv()

# Instantiate a Portia instance. Load it with the default config and with the example tools.
portia = Portia(tools=example_tool_registry)

# Generate the plan from the user query
plan = portia.plan('Which stock price grew faster in 2024, Amazon or Google?')

# [OPTIONAL] INSERT CODE WHERE YOU SERVE THE PLAN TO THE USER OR ITERATE ON IT IN ANY WAY

# Run the generated plan
plan_run = portia.run_plan(plan)

# Serialise into JSON and print the output
print(plan_run.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="async" label="Async">
```python title="main.py"
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from portia import (
    Portia,
    example_tool_registry,
)

load_dotenv()

# Instantiate a Portia instance. Load it with the default config and with the example tools.
portia = Portia(tools=example_tool_registry)

async def main():
    # Generate the plan from the user query
    plan = await portia.aplan('Which stock price grew faster in 2024, Amazon or Google?')

    # [OPTIONAL] INSERT CODE WHERE YOU SERVE THE PLAN TO THE USER OR ITERATE ON IT IN ANY WAY

    # Run the generated plan
    plan_run = await portia.arun_plan(plan)

    # Serialise into JSON and print the output
    print(plan_run.model_dump_json(indent=2))

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Here we are storing the `Plan` object returned by the `plan` method. We then use the `run_plan` method to start a `PlanRun`.

:::info
If you want to see an example where a user iterates on a plan before we proceed with plan run, take a look at the intro example in our <a href="https://github.com/portiaAI/portia-agent-examples/blob/main/get_started_google_tools/README.md" target="_blank">**examples repo (↗)**</a>.
:::

## Run directly from a user query
<details>
<summary>**Tavily API key required**</summary>

We will use a simple GET endpoint from Tavily in this section. Please sign up to obtain an API key from them (<a href="https://tavily.com/" target="_blank">**↗**</a>) and set it in the environment variable `TAVILY_API_KEY`.
</details>

You can also run a plan immediately from the user query, without examining the `Plan` object in between. This would generate a plan as an intermediate step as well but will also immediately spawn a plan run from it. You would simply use the `run` method from your `Portia` instance class like so:
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="sync" label="Sync" default>
```python title="main.py"
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from portia import (
    Portia,
    example_tool_registry,
)

load_dotenv()

# Instantiate a Portia instance. Load it with the default config and with the example tools.
portia = Portia(tools=example_tool_registry)

# Generate the plan from the user query
plan_run = portia.run('Which stock price grew faster in 2024, Amazon or Google?')

# Serialise into JSON and print the output
print(plan_run.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="async" label="Async">
```python title="main.py"
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from portia import (
    Portia,
    example_tool_registry,
)

load_dotenv()

# Instantiate a Portia instance. Load it with the default config and with the example tools.
portia = Portia(tools=example_tool_registry)

async def main():
    # Generate the plan from the user query
    plan_run = await portia.arun('Which stock price grew faster in 2024, Amazon or Google?')

    # Serialise into JSON and print the output
    print(plan_run.model_dump_json(indent=2))

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
:::note[Track plan run states in logs]
You can track plan run state changes live as they occur through the logs by setting `default_log_level` to DEBUG in the `Config` of your `Portia` instance (<a href="/manage-config#manage-logging" target="_blank">**Manage logging ↗**</a>).
:::

## Run a plan stored in Portia cloud

When you set the storage_class property to CLOUD in the config of your Portia instance (see <a href="/manage-config##manage-storage-options" target="_blank">**Manage storage options ↗**</a> for more details), plans will automatically be stored in the cloud once created. You can then easily retrieve plans from storage in order to run them:

<!-- Setup a plan with the correct id. This won't be rendered on the website
```python id=plan_invisible_setup
from portia.plan import PlanBuilder, PlanUUID
from portia import Portia
from uuid import UUID
portia = Portia()
plan = PlanBuilder("test").build()
plan_id = PlanUUID(uuid=UUID("f8003b53-9b62-44e2-ac67-887146c07949"))
plan.id = plan_id
try:
  if not portia.storage.get_plan(plan_id):
    portia.storage.save_plan(plan)
except Exception as e:
  pass
```
-->

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="sync" label="Sync" default>
```python depends_on=plan_invisible_setup patch=portia_run_plan
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from portia import (
    Portia,
    default_config,
    Config,
    StorageClass,
    PlanUUID
)

# Load the Portia API key
load_dotenv()

# Set up the Portia instance to use cloud storage
config = Config.from_default(storage_class=StorageClass.CLOUD)
portia = Portia(config=config)

# This will create a plan that is stored in Portia Cloud
plan = portia.plan('Which stock price grew faster in 2024, Amazon or Google?')

# We can then either run the plan directly from the object...
run = portia.run_plan(plan=plan)

# Or we can use the ID so that the plan is loaded from storage
run = portia.run_plan(plan=PlanUUID.from_string("plan-f8003b53-9b62-44e2-ac67-887146c07949"))
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="async" label="Async">
```python depends_on=plan_invisible_setup patch=portia_run_plan patch=portia_arun_plan
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from portia import (
    Portia,

    Config,
    StorageClass,
    PlanUUID
)

# Load the Portia API key
load_dotenv()

# Set up the Portia instance to use cloud storage
config = Config.from_default(storage_class=StorageClass.CLOUD)
portia = Portia(config=config)

async def main():
    # This will create a plan that is stored in Portia Cloud
    plan = await portia.aplan('Which stock price grew faster in 2024, Amazon or Google?')

    # We can then either run the plan directly from the object...
    run = await portia.arun_plan(plan=plan)

    # Or we can use the ID so that the plan is loaded from storage
    run = await portia.arun_plan(plan=PlanUUID.from_string("plan-f8003b53-9b62-44e2-ac67-887146c07949"))

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This can be very useful if you want to run a plan from a different process to the one that created the plan.
