Portia classes that plan and execute runs for queries.

This module contains the core classes responsible for generating, managing, and executing plans
in response to queries. The `Portia` class serves as the main entry point, orchestrating the
planning and execution process. It uses various agents and tools to carry out tasks step by step,
saving the state of the run at each stage. It also handles error cases, clarification
requests, and run state transitions.

The `Portia` class provides methods to:

- Generate a plan for executing a query.
- Create and manage runs.
- Execute runs step by step, using agents to handle the execution of tasks.
- Resolve clarifications required during the execution of runs.
- Wait for runs to reach a state where they can be resumed.

Modules in this file work with different storage backends (memory, disk, cloud) and can handle
complex queries using various planning and execution agent configurations.

## Portia Objects

```python
class Portia()
```

Portia client is the top level abstraction and entrypoint for most programs using the SDK.

It is responsible for intermediating planning via PlanningAgents and
execution via ExecutionAgents.

#### \_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(config: Config | None = None,
             tools: ToolRegistry | list[Tool] | None = None,
             execution_hooks: ExecutionHooks | None = None,
             telemetry: BaseProductTelemetry | None = None) -> None
```

Initialize storage and tools.

**Arguments**:

- `config` _Config_ - The configuration to initialize the Portia client. If not provided, the
  default configuration will be used.
- `tools` _ToolRegistry | list[Tool]_ - The registry or list of tools to use. If not
  provided, the open source tool registry will be used, alongside the default tools
  from Portia cloud if a Portia API key is set.
- `execution_hooks` _ExecutionHooks | None_ - Hooks that can be used to modify or add
  extra functionality to the run of a plan.
- `telemetry` _BaseProductTelemetry | None_ - Anonymous telemetry service.

#### initialize\_end\_user

```python
def initialize_end_user(end_user: str | EndUser | None = None) -> EndUser
```

Handle initializing the end_user based on the provided type.

#### run

```python
def run(query: str,
        tools: list[Tool] | list[str] | None = None,
        example_plans: list[Plan] | None = None,
        end_user: str | EndUser | None = None,
        plan_run_inputs: list[PlanInput] | list[dict[str, str]]
        | dict[str, str] | None = None,
        structured_output_schema: type[BaseModel] | None = None,
        use_cached_plan: bool = False) -> PlanRun
```

End-to-end function to generate a plan and then execute it.

This is the simplest way to plan and execute a query using the SDK.

**Arguments**:

- `query` _str_ - The query to be executed.
- `tools` _list[Tool] | list[str] | None_ - List of tools to use for the query.
  If not provided all tools in the registry will be used.
- `example_plans` _list[Plan] | None_ - Optional list of example plans. If not
  provide a default set of example plans will be used.
- `end_user` _str | EndUser | None = None_ - The end user for this plan run.
  plan_run_inputs (list[PlanInput] | list[dict[str, str]] | dict[str, str] | None):
  Provides input values for the run. This can be a list of PlanInput objects, a list
  of dicts with keys &quot;name&quot;, &quot;description&quot; (optional) and &quot;value&quot;, or a dict of
  plan run input name to value.
- `structured_output_schema` _type[BaseModel] | None_ - The optional structured output schema
  for the query. This is passed on to plan runs created from this plan but will not be
  stored with the plan itself if using cloud storage and must be re-attached to the
  plan run if using cloud storage.
- `use_cached_plan` _bool_ - Whether to use a cached plan if it exists.
  

**Returns**:

- `PlanRun` - The run resulting from executing the query.

#### plan

```python
def plan(query: str,
         tools: list[Tool] | list[str] | None = None,
         example_plans: list[Plan] | None = None,
         end_user: str | EndUser | None = None,
         plan_inputs: list[PlanInput] | list[dict[str, str]] | list[str]
         | None = None,
         structured_output_schema: type[BaseModel] | None = None,
         use_cached_plan: bool = False) -> Plan
```

**Arguments**:

- `query` _str_ - The query to generate the plan for.

  of inputs required for the plan.
  This can be a list of Planinput objects, a list of dicts with keys &quot;name&quot; and
  &quot;description&quot; (optional), or a list of plan run input names. If a value is provided
  with a PlanInput object or in a dictionary, it will be ignored as values are only
  used when running the plan.
- `structured_output_schema` _type[BaseModel] | None_ - The optional structured output schema
  for the query. This is passed on to plan runs created from this plan but will be
  not be stored with the plan itself if using cloud storage and must be re-attached
  to the plan run if using cloud storage.
- `use_cached_plan` _bool_ - Whether to use a cached plan if it exists.
  

**Returns**:

#### resume

```python

           plan_run_id: PlanRunUUID | str | None = None) -> PlanRun
```

Resume a PlanRun.

If a clarification handler was provided as part of the execution hooks, it will be used
to handle any clarifications that are raised during the execution of the plan run.
If no clarification handler was provided and a clarification is raised, the run will be
returned in the `NEED_CLARIFICATION` state. The clarification will then need to be handled
by the caller before the plan run is resumed.
